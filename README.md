## Quad ![Build Status](https://github.com/mbutterick/quad/workflows/CI/badge.svg)


A work-in-progress document processor written in [Racket](http://racket-lang.org). 

Create PDFs from a simple text-based source format. Use any TTF or OTF or WOFF fonts you like.

Quad lets you avoid:

* word processors
* page-layout programs
* web browsers
* LaTeX and derivatives
* subscriptions, surveillance, and “creative clouds”

Quad, by contrast —

* is downloadable & self-contained
* is open source
* makes document layout fast & easy
* uses source files that are portable between Mac OS, Windows, and Linux
* works with [Pollen](//pollenpub.com)

## Install

Using Racket 6.10+, install from the command line:

    raco pkg install quad
    
And update like so:

    raco pkg update --update-deps quad

## Project status

Actively developed, though progress tends to go in bursts due to other commitments. Even when I’m not committing code to Quad, I am thinking about it.
